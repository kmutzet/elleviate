## Mission Statement

Empowering Women with Accessible, Personalized Gynecology Care

## Problem Statement

Low-income women in the United States face disproportionate barriers to accessing healthcare. Gender economic inequality means women are less likely to have insurance, compromising their ability to pay for treatments and services. According to the National Library of Medicine, many women pay out-of-pocket for critical preventative screening examinations such as pap smears, mammograms, and colonoscopies (Cardoso et al., 2021). A 2022 survey on how the COVID-19 pandemic has impacted access to health care revealed that one in four women have experienced a disruption to healthcare access and 16% of women have experienced disruptions to gynecologic care access (Turner et al., 2022). Furthermore, cancer survivors have a higher probability of delayed access (RAD-AID International, n.d.).

These factors drive up the mortality rate for women because they are at higher risk of dying from preventable conditions such as pregnancy complications, disease, and chronic illnesses. Children of women who have been denied treatment are also at higher risk for developmental disorders, malnutrition and chronic illnesses, and the likelihood of death in infancy increases. Children in poor health are more susceptible to lower educational opportunities, and treating chronic illness raises the cost of childcare for mothers, causing even more financial strain on women already facing difficulties accessing health care for themselves (Zephyrin et al., 2020).

One existing solution is the Affordable Care Act, which creates more affordable health insurance and programs like RAD-AID to cover services like breast and cervical cancer screenings as well as radiology. While this policy mandates that preventative care services be included in insurance, its programs are limited in scope to specific locations, and women must meet specific criteria to access them. Women of color, transgender women, and other marginalized groups are disproportionately harmed by these limitations because it is more difficult for them to meet the program criteria as well as live in areas where programs are active (Cardoso et al, 2021). Therefore, comprehensively addressing these shortcomings will significantly improve the health of low-income women and future generations.
